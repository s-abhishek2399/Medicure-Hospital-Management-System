        <h1 id="ecc">
            <hr> <br> The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.
            <br> The BMI calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared. For example, A BMI of 25 means 25kg/m2.
            <br><br> BMI Ranges
            <br>
            <br> For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the 18.5 to 24.9 range.<br> For children and young people aged 2 to 18, <br> The BMI calculation takes into account age and gender as well as height and weight. <br> If your BMI is: below 18.5 – you're
            in the underweight <br>range between 18.5 and 24.9 – you're in the healthy <br>weight range between 25 and 29.9 – you're in the overweight <br> range between 30 and 39.9 – you're in the obese range
